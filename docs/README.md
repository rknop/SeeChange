# SeeChange Documentation

To build this in your local checkout:

* Go into the `docs` subdirectory (i.e. the one this README.md file is in)
* `make html`
* Install all the things you need to install to fix the errors you just got
* `make html`
* Point your browser at `file:///.../docs/_build/html/index.html`, where `...` is the absolute path to your SeeChange checkout
