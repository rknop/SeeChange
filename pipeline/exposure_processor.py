        """A class that processes all images in a single exposure, potentially using multiprocessing.

        It's sort of a wrapper around top_level.py::Pipeline, but
        handles downloading exposures, some updates of the
        knownexposures table, and running lots of processes each
        of which run a single Pipeline (on one chip).

        This is used internally by ExposureLauncher; normally, you would not use it directly.

        Parameters
        ----------
        instrument : str
          The name of the instrument

        identifier : str
          The identifier of the exposure (as defined in the KnownExposures model)

        numprocs: int
          Number of worker processes (not including the manager process)
          to run at once.  0 or 1 = do all work in the main manager process.

        cluster_id: str

        node_id: str

        machine_name: str or None

        onlychips : list, default None
          If not None, will only process the sensor sections whose names
          match something in this list.  If None, will process all
          sensor sections returned by the instrument's get_section_ids()
          class method.

        through_step : str or None
          Passed on to top_level.py::Pipeline

        worker_log_level : log level, default logging.WARNING
          The log level for the worker processes.  Here so that you can
          have a different log level for the overall control process
          than in the individual processes that run the actual pipeline.

"""Process a single known exposure.

This is what you use to manually force the pipeline to run a specific
exposure.  If you want to bulk process exposures specified by the
conductor, instead use pipeline_exposure_launcher, or another utility
designed for and launching slurm jobs (which is as of this writing under
construction).

This will process an exposure through the step specified by
--through-step (or all steps, if --through-step isn't given).  The
exposure must be in the knownexposures table.  If --cont is given, it
will pick up an exposure that has already been started partway, and do
the rest of the processing on it.

exposure_processor will launch multiple subprocesses; each subprocess
will run chip of the exposure at a time.  (If there are enough
subprocesses, then each subprocess will only one run chip.  If there are
fewer subprocesses than chips, then as a subprocess finishes one chip,
it will start one of the leftovers.)  Be careful not to oversubscribe
your CPUs.  There are two ways this can happen.  First, you can just
specify too many subprocesses.  Second, it's possible that some
libraries may use OpenMP or similar internally.  If that's the case,
make sure to set the appropriate environment variables to instruct them
to only use one process (or as many as you can afford, if you have more
CPUs than you intend to launch subprocesses).  As of this writing, the
following environment varaibles should be set to 1 (or to the number of
subprocesses you might want things to use):
  OMP_NUM_THREADS
  OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS
  MKL_NUM_THREADS
  VECLIB_MAXIMUM_THREADS
(Probably not all of the libraires referenced by these environment
variables are actually used in SeeChange, but it won't hurt to set the
environment variable anyway.)

TODO: provide a mechanism to run an exposure that's *not* in the
knownexpsoures table.

Warning: be careful.  exposure_processor does not contact the conductor,
nor does it entirely verify that another process isn't already working
on this exposure.  It will just update the state in the knownexposures
table without regard to what was there before.  If two processes work on
the same exposure at the same time, you may make a tremendous mess.  To
be safe, make sure that this exposure is in a state other than "ready"
(i.e. one of "held", "running", or "done") in the conductor.  If the
current state is "running", make sure that it's not really running
(i.e. the process that said it was running crashed).  If the current
state is "claimed", be *very* careful, as another process might be about
to start it.
