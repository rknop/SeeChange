        The possible keywords that can be given are: maker, pipeline,
        coaddition. Each should be a dictionary.  maker keys are defined
        by ParsRefMaker above.  pipeline keys are defined as described
        pipeline/top_level.py::Pipeline, and may have subdictionaries
        pipeline, preprocessing, extraction, sources, bg, wcs, and zp.
        coaddition keys are defined by
        pipeline/coaddition.py::ParsCoadd.

        Parameters are set by first looking at the referencing.pipeline,
        referencing.coaddition, and referncing.maker trees from the
        config file.  They are then overridden by anything passed to the
        constructor.

        The maker contains a Pipeline object, that doesn't do any work,
        but is instantiated so it can build up the provenances of the
        images and their products, that go into the coaddition.  Those
        images need to already exist in the database before calling
        run().  Pass kwargs into the pipeline object using
        kwargs['pipeline'].

        The maker also contains a coadd_pipeline object, that has two
        roles: one is to build the provenances of the coadd image and
        the products of that image (extraction on the coadd) and the
        second is to actually do the work of coadding the chosen images.
        Pass kwargs into this object using kwargs['coaddition'].

        The choice of which images are loaded into the reference coadd
        is determined by the parameters object of the maker itself (and
        the provenances of the images and their products).  To set these
        parameters, use the "referencing.maker" dictionary in the

        There are three modes in which RefMaker can operate:

        * If the corner_distance parameter is None, then we're making a
          reference that covers a single point (useful for forced
          photometry, for instance).  In this case, either specify an
          image (in which case its central ra and dec are used), or
          specify ra/dec.

        * If the corner_distance parameter is not None, we're making a
          reference that covers a rectangle on the sky (covering at
          least the overlap_fraction parameter of the rectangle).  In
          this case, either specify an image that defines the rectangle
          on the sky, or specify minra/maxra/mindec/maxdec.  The rectangle
          is aligned to NS/EW.

        Parameters
        ----------
          image: str or None
            The id of the image, or a substring of the filepath of the
            image.  If the substring is not unique (i.e. there are
            multiple images with this substring), an exception will be
            raised.

          image_zp_prov_id: str or None
            Ignored if image is not None.  If not None, then will search
            for a zeropoint of this provenance that goes with iamge, and
            then will use the WCSes "good" limits to figure out the
            min/max ra/dec rather than the corners in the image.

          ra, dec: float or None
            Position to search.   Only makes sense if pars.corner_distance is None

          minra, maxra, mindec, maxdec: float or None
            Area to search.  Only makes sense if pars.corner_disdtance is not None

          target, section_id: string or None
            Optionally, specify a target and section_id that images must
            have to be considered for inclusion in a reference.  Only
            use this if you're using a survey that's very careful about
            setting its target names, and if you always go back to
            exactly the same fields so you know that the same chip is
            always going to be in the same place.

          filter: string or None
            If given, only find images whose filter match this filter

          mjd: float or None
            Find references suitable for an image at this mjd.  If None,
            and image is not None, will pull the mjd from teh database
            record for the image.
