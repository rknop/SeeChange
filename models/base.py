        when you call the object's close method.  (This may or may not
        actually close the connection to the database, based on how the
        class was instantiated.)  Better, use this inside a context
        manager; then the connection is relinquished when the connection

        when the with block ends.

        In the event that you're opening a new connection, it will retry
        the connection if it fails with a psycopg.OperationalError.

        being too many connections to the database.  (If everybody is

        long.)  If you don't want it to do this, pass the optional
        parameter maxsleep=0. to the constructor.

        Parameters
        ----------
          con : psycopg.Connection, psycopg.Cursor, PGDB, or (shudder) sa.orm.session.Session
            If None (the default), will make a new connection, and will
            roll back and close it when done.  If not None, then will
            instead wrap this connection; when close() is called, or
            when the context manager that created this object ends, will
            roll back and close the connection.  However, if con is not
            None, then the assumption is that somebody else is managing
            the connection, so will not rollback or close.

          dictcursor : bool, default False
            If True, then the cursor uses psycopg.rows.dict_row as its
            row factory.  execite() will return a list of dictionaries,
            with each element of the list being one row of the result.
            If False, then execute returns two lists: a list of tuples
            (the rows) and a list of strings (the column names).

          sleept, sleepmin, sleepfac, sleepfuzz, sleepmax : passed to util.util.retry_with_sleep
            If it needs to make a new connection to the database, and
            the connection fails because of a psycopg.OperationalError,
            it will retry, configured by these values.  They default to

        Will *not* update self's fields with server default values!
        Re-get the database row if you want that.

        Will assign the object an id if it doesn't alrady have one (in self.id).

        If the object is already there, will NOT update any association
        tables (e.g. the image_upstreams_association table), because we
        do not define any SQLAlchemy relationships.  Those must have
        been set when the object was first loaded.

        Be careful with this.  There are some cases where we do want to
        update database records (e.g. the images table once we know
        fwhm, depth, etc), but most of the time we don't want to update
        the database after the first save.

        Parameters
        ----------
          session: PGDB, psycopg.Connect, psycopg.Cursor, sa.orm.session.Session, or None
            Usually you don't want to pass this.

          load_defaults: bool, default False
            Normally, will *not* update self's fields with server
            default values.  Set this to True for that to happen.  (This

        # Doing this manually because I don't think SQLAlchemy has a
        #   clean and direct upsert statement.
        #
        # Used to do this with a lock table followed by search followed
        #   by either an insert or an update.  However, SQLAlchemy
        #   wasn't always closing connections when we told it to.
        #   Sometimes, rarely and unreproducably, there was a lingering
        #   connection in a transaction that caused lock tables to fail.
        #   My hypothesis is that SQLAlchemy is relying on garbage
        #   collection to *actually* close database connections, and I
        #   have not found a way to say "no, really, close the
        #   connection for this session right now".  So, as long as we
        #   still use SQLAlchemy at all, locking tables is likely to
        #   cause intermittent problems.

class FileOnDiskMixin:
    """Mixin for objects that refer to files on disk.

    Files are assumed to live on the local disk (underneath the
    configured path.data_root), and optionally on a archive server
    (configured through the subproperties of "archive" in the yaml
    config file).  The property filepath is the path relative to the
    root in both cases.

    If there is a single file associated with this entry, then filepath
    has the name of that file.  md5sum holds a checksum for the file,
    *if* it has been correctly saved to the archive.  If the file has
    not been saved to the archive, md5sum is null.  In this case,
    components and md5sum_components will be null.  (Exception: if you
    are configured with a null archive (config parameter archive in the
    yaml config file is null), then md5sum will be set when the image is
    saved to disk, instead of when it's saved to the archive.)

    If there are multiple files associated with this entry, then
    filepath is the beginning of the names of all the files.  The full
    filenames are constrcuted by appending ".", the component name
    (stored in self.components), and the file suffix (returned by
    self._file_suffix(comp)) to filepath.  For example, if an image file
    has the image itself, an associated weight, and an associated mask,
    then filepath might be "image" and components might be ["image",
    "mask", "weight"] to indicate that the three files image.image.fits,
    image.mask.fits, and image.weight.fits are all associated with this
    entry.  When components is non-null, md5sum should be null, and
    md5sum_components is an array with the same length as components.
    (For extension files that have not yet been saved to the archive,
    that element of the md5sum_components array is null.)

    Saving data:

    Any object that implements this mixin must call this class' "save"
    method in order to save the data to disk.  (This may be through
    super() if the subclass has to do custom things.)  The save method
    of this class will save to the local filestore (underneath
    path.data_root), and also save it to the archive.  Once a file is
    saved on the archive, the md5sum (or md5sum_copmonents) field in the
    database record is updated.  (If the file has not been saved to the
    archive, then the md5sum and md5sum_components fields will be null.)

    Loading data:

    When calling get_fullpath(), the object will first check if the file
    exists locally, and then it will import it from archive if missing
    (and if archive is defined).  If you want to avoid downloading, use
    get_fullpath(download=False) or get_fullpath(nofile=True).  (The
    latter case won't even try to find the file on the local disk, it
    will just tell you what the path should be.)  If you want to always
    get a list of filepaths (even if components=None) use
    get_fullpath(as_list=True).  If the file is missing locally, and
    downloading cannot proceed (because no archive is defined, or
    because the download=False flag is used, or because the file is
    missing from server), then the call to get_fullpath() will raise an
    exception (unless you use download=False or nofile=True).

    After all the pulling from the archive is done and the file(s) exist
    locally, the full (absolute) path to the local file is returned.  It
    is then up to the inheriting object (e.g., the Exposure or Image) to
    actually load the file from disk and figure out what to do with the
    data.

    The path to the local file store and the archive object are saved in
    class variables "local_path" and "archive" that are initialized from
    the config system the first time the class is loaded.

        object with self.nofile=True will be associated with a file later on.

        If the file is found on the local drive, under the local_path,
        (either it was there or after it was downloaded)
        the full path is returned.
        The application is then responsible for loading the content
        of the file.

        When the components is None, will return a single string.
        When the components is an array, will return a list of strings.
        If as_list=False, will always return a list of strings,
        even if components is None.

        Parameters
        ----------
        download: bool
            Whether to download the file from server if missing.
            Must have archive defined. Default is True.

            Default is False.

        components: list, str, or None
            Which components to get.  Must be None if self.components is
            None None.  If not given, defaults to self.components.

        nofile: bool
            Whether to check if the file exists on local disk.
            Default is None, which means use the value of self.nofile.

        always_verify_md5: bool
            Set True to verify that the file's md5sum matches what's
            in the database (if there is one in the database), and
            raise an exception if it doesn't.  Ignored if nofile=True.

        Returns
        -------
        str or list of str
            Absolute path to the file(s) on local disk.

                 what's on the archive is right.

        no_archive: bool
          If True, do *not* save to the archive, only to the local filesystem.

        If data is a "bytes" type, then it represents the relevant
        binary data.  It will be written to the right place in the local
        filestore (underneath path.data_root).

        If data is a pathlib.Path or a string, then it is the
        (resolvable) path to a file on disk.  In this case, if the file
        is already in the right place underneath path.data_root, it is
        just left in place (modulo verify_md5).  Otherwise, it is copied
        there.

        Then, in either case, the file is uploaded to the archive (if
        the class property archive is not None, modul verify_md5).  Once
        it's uploaded to the archive, the object's md5sum is set (or
        updated, if overwrite is True and it wasn't null to start with).

        If component is not None, and it isn't already in the list of
        components, it will be added.

        Performance notes: if you call this with anything other than
        overwrite=False, exists_ok=True, verify_md5=False, you may well
        have redundant I/O.  You may have saved an image before, and
        then (for instance) called
        pipeline.data_store.save_and_commit(), which will at the very
        least read things to verify that md5sums match.

        Of course, not either using overwrite=True or verify_md5=True
        could lead to incorrect files in either the local filestore on
        the server not being detected.

class UUIDMixin:
    # We use UUIDs rather than auto-incrementing SQL sequences for
    # unique object primary keys so that we can generate unique ids
    # without having to contact the database.  This allows us, for
    # example, to build up a collection of objects including foreign
    # keys to each other, and save them to the database at the end.
    # With auto-generating primary keys, we wouldn't be able to set the
    # foreign keys until we'd saved the referenced object to the
    # databse, so that its id was generated.  (SQLAlchemy gets around
    # this with object relationships, but object relationships in SA
    # caused us so many headaches that we stopped using them.)  It also
    # allows us to do things like cache objects that we later load into
    # the database, without worrying that the cached object's id (and
    # references amongst multiple cached objects) will be inconsistent
    # with the state of the database counters.

    # Note that even though the default is uuid.uuid4(), this is set by SQLAlchemy
    #   when the object is saved to the database, not when the object is created.
    #   It will be None when a new object is created if not explicitly set.
    #   (In practice, often this id will get set by our code when we access the
    #   id property of a created object before it's saved to the datbase, or it will
    #   be set in our insert/upsert methods, as we only very rarely let SQLAlchemy
    #   itself actually save anything to the database.)
    # ...and that was really annoying, because as I wrote more code that didn't
    #   use SQLAlchemy, having SQLAlchmey handle the default was troublesome.
    #   However, I'm afraid of removing the SQLAlchmey default, because it will
    #   probably break lots of code in lots of places, so just try putting in

        have an id property.  This will be the case for objects that inherit
        from UUIDMixin, as most of ours do.

        Parameters
        ----------
          value: str or None
            If str, a comma-separated string indicating the badnesses to set.
            If None, it means save this object's own bitflag as is to the
            database.  It doesn't make sense to use value=None and
            commit=False.

          commit: bool, default True
            If True, and the object is already in the database, will save the
            bitflag changes to the database.  If False, then it's the
            responsibility of the calling function to make sure they get saved
            if necessary.  (That can be accomplished with a subsequent call to
            obj.set_badness( None, commit=True ).)

            (If the object isn't already in the database, then nothing gets
            saved.  However, in that case, when the object is later saved, it
            will get saved with its value of _bitflag then, so things will all
            work out in the end.)
