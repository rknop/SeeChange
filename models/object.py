        Indeed, the measurements probably can't already be in the

        called before the measurements were saved in the first place.
        It is the responsibility of the calling function to actually
        save the all the measurements in the measurements list to the
        database (if it wants them saved).

        Parameters
        ----------
          measurements : list of Measurements
            The measurmentses with which to associate objects.

          radius : float
            The search radius in arseconds.  If an existing object is
            within this distance on the sky of a Measurements' ra/dec,
            then that Measurements will be associated with that object.
            If None, will be set to measuring.association_radius from
            the config.

          year, month, day : int, default None
            The UTC date of the time of exposure of the image from which
            the measurements come.  May be needed to generate object
            names based on the format configured in object.namefmt in
            the config yaml.  May always be omitted if no_new is True.

          no_new : bool, default False
            Normally, if an existing object is not wthin radius of one
            of the Measurements objects in the list given in the
            measurements parameter, then a new object will be created at
            the ra and dec of that Measurements and saved to the
            database.  Set no_new to True to not create any new objects,
            but to leave the object_id field of unassociated
            Measurements objects as is (probably None).

          no_associate_legacy_survey : bool, default False
            Normally, when a new object is created, call
            ObjectLegacySurveyMatch.create_new_object_matches on the
            object. Set this to False to skip that step.

          liumatch_radius : float, default None
            Radius in arcseconds to match to Legacy Survey objects.  If
            no_associate_legacy_survey is False, then something must be
            passed here.

          liumatch_server : str, default None
            Location of the liumatch server for Legacy Survey object
            mathcing.  If no_associate_legacy_survey is False, then
            something must be passed here.

          no_associate_gaia : bool, default False
            Normally, when a new object is created, call
            ObjectGaiaMatch.create_new_object_matches on the object.
            Set this to False to skip that step.

          gaiamatch_radius : bool, default False
            Radius in arcseconds to match to Gaia DR3 objects.  If
            no_associate_gaia is False, then something must be passed
            here.

          gaiacat : CatalogExerpt or None
            Catalog of gaia objects to pass on to the association with
            Gaia objects in the case of new objects.  If None, will
            search the external gaia server in a small patch around the
            object position.

          is_testing : bool, default False
            Never use this.  If True, the only associate measurements
            with objects that have the is_test property set to True, and
            set that property for any newly created objects.  (This
            parameter is used in some of our tests, but should not be
            used outside of that context.)

          connection : psycopg.Connection
            Database connection.  Will create and close one if this is
            None.

          nocommit : bool, default False
            Do not commit to the database at the end of doing all the
            things.  You really want to leave this at False; it's here
            for test_generate_names_race_condition in

        """Generate one or more names for an object based on the time of discovery.

        Valid things in format specifier that will be replaced are:
          %y - 2-digit year.  If you use this, then you hate everybody.
          %Y - 4-digit year.
          %m - 2-digit month.
          %d - 2-digit day.
          %R - RA in degrees (using format "08.4f").
          %D - dec in degrees (using format "+08.4f").
          %a - set of lowercase letters, starting with a..z, then aa..az..zz, then aaa..aaz..zzz, etc.  (Sorta.)
          %A - set of uppercase letters, similar.
          %n - an integer that starts at 0 and increments with each object added.
          %l - a randomly generated lowercase letter.  Should probably be used more than once if used at all.
          %% - a literal %.

        It doesn't make sense to use more than one of (%a, %A, %n).

        All of (%a, %A, %n) look at the passed year.  They start over
        for each year, and look at the table object_name_max_used in the
        database to figure out which names have been used for the passed
        year. (That table is locked while in use to guarantee that
        multiple processes won't generate the same name at the same
        time.)

        Parameters
        ----------
          number : int, default 1
            Number of names to generate

          formatstr: str, default None.
            See above.  If None, defaults to Config.get().value(
            'object.namefmt' ), which is usually what you want.

          year : int
            The year in which the object was discovered.  Required if the
            format string includes %y, %Y, %a, %A, or %n.

          month: int
            The month in which the object was discovered.  Required if
            the format string includes %m.

          day: int
            The UTC day of the month on which the object was
            discovered. Required if the format string includes %d.

          verifyunique : bool, default False
            Verify that generated object names don't already exist in
            the database.  Defaults to False, because if you're using a
            %A- or %a-based name, the way the code works guarantees that
            already.  But, if you're doing things like ra and dec, you
            might want this just to be sure.

          seed : random seed for %l in the format string.  Never use
            this (unless you're writing a test and need reproducible
            results).

          connection : psycopg.Connection or None
            Database connection.  Only used if %A, %a, or %n is in the
            format string, or if verifyunique is True.  If %A, %a, or %n
            is in the format string, the connection will be comitted.
            If no connection is passed and one is needed, then a new
            connection will be created and then closed (perhaps twice).

          nocommit : boolean, default True
            Don't commit to the database even if changes are made.  For
            normal use case, you want to leave this as True.  The reason
            to leave this true is that if you commit, you will lose any
            table locks.  Normal use of this function is from
            Object.associate_measurements(), which acquires a table lock
            on the objects table; committing would lose that.  This does
            mean that you need to make sure to commit to the databse in
            the function that called this; otherwise, any modifications
            made to the object_name_max_used table will get lost.

class ObjectPosition( Base, UUIDMixin, SpatiallyIndexed ):
    """ObjectPosition stores a mean position of an object.

    Because our objects are (mostly) supposed to be immutable once they
    are created in the database, we aren't supposed to update the ra/dec
    field of Object after it's first created.  However, as we get more
    observations of a single object, we (in principle) have better
    measurements of the position of that object.  Jibing that with the
    provenance model is a bit challenging, though.  The provenance of an
    object position depends on exactly which measurements went into it,
    and because that comes from many different images, it's not as
    simple as most of our provenance.

    ObjectPositions are calculated by pipeline/positioner.py

    To make this as reproducible as possible, object position provenance
    will include a date_calculated parameter.  The idea is that when
    calculating an object provenance, only images from before that date
    will be included in the calculation.  This still isn't completely
    reproducible, as it's entirely possible that images from earlier
    dates will be added to the database *after* the object position is
    calculated.  However, with some care from the people running the
    pipeline, this can approximate that.  Certainly for things like Data
    Releases, this is possible, as long as things are done in the same
    order.

    (Note that Objects themselves don't have provenance, but are global
    things.  However, ObjectPosition does have a provenance.  At some
    level, you can think of Object as putting a flag down saying "this
    is the name of an object".  The ra/dec in the objects table is a
    first approximation of the object's position (and, at least as of
    this writing, is what's used for associating measurements).
    ObjectPosition represents an actual measurement.)

    (One might argue that ObjectPosition should be updated based on
    position-variable forced photometry (if that's not an oxymoron), but
    in practice basing it on DIA discoveries will give you pretty much
    the same answer, and it's not worth getting fiddly about the
    difference.)

            If this is not None, you probably want to set
            ignore_existing to False, and commit will be made False
            regardless of what you pass.

          ignore_existing : bool, default False
            Don't look in the database for existing matches to the
            object, but go out to the external server and find the matches
            afresh.  Requires a non-None radius.

          verify_existing : bool, default False
            If True, always go to the external server to get matches and
            verify that any existing matches are the same.  Doesn't make
            sense to set this True if ignore_existing is True.

          commit : bool, default True
            Set this to False to not commit found matches to the
            database.  If radius is non-None, this will be forced to
            True regardless of what you pass.

          con : psycopg.Connection, default None
            Database connection.  If not given, makes and closes a new
            one.  WARNING: even if commit=False, this connection will be
